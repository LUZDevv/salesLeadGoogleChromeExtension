# sales Leads tracker Chrome Extension Project ABOUT - skip to the ' ' section for instructions on how to install and use said tracker

Greetings! This 'Sales Lead Tracker Google Chrome Extension'Program is made by Scrimba's project instructions given by instructor 'Per Harald Borgen' that were coded up by me, with further added functionalities devised and programmed by me, 'Luis Uribe Zambrano' 
that consist of: allowing you to copy all links into text that formats each new link in a new line break, gives you the ability to only copy one link from your visible list at a time if needed, added copy clipboard icons,
gave each button different colors for further differentiation, and did further CSS work to add a bit more visual and UX support for the Chrome extension.
"name": "Leads tracker",
Since I made edits, we can consider this version of "Leads tracker" to be 'version 1.1'.
